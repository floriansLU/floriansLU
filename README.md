- 👋 Hi, I’m @floriansLU. This account is for my work at the University of Latvia (LU).
- 👀 I’m interested in numerically simulating atoms and atom-like systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the simulations, I'm most interested in Python and Julia.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia and the QuantumOptics.jl package.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at helmuth at lu dot lv.
